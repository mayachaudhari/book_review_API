## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository

      git clone <repository-url>
   cd book-review-api
   

2. Install dependencies

      npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   

3. Configure environment variables

   * Create a file named .env in the project root
   * Add the following variables:

     MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/book-review-api
     JWT_SECRET=your_super_secure_jwt_secret_key
     PORT=5000
     JWT_EXPIRE=30d
     

4. Start MongoDB

   * If running locally:

          mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf
     
   * Or configure MongoDB Atlas URI in MONGO_URI

5. Run the server

   * Development (with nodemon):

          npm run dev
     
   * Production:

          npm start
     

The server will start on http://localhost:5000 by default.

## Security & Best Practices

* Store secrets in .env, never commit it to version control.
* Use HTTPS in production.
* Implement rate limiting to mitigate abuse.
* Add refresh tokens for improved auth UX.
* Write unit and integration tests (e.g., Jest, Supertest).

---

## Future Improvements

* File upload support for book covers.
* Role-based access control (admin, user, moderator).
* Caching with Redis for high-read endpoints.
* Email notifications for new reviews.
